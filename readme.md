# react-gen Under development

-> Will soon be documented and published as npm package

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions to install the following packages:
- Flow
- Storybook
- Jest
- Enzyme

## Installation & Usage

```
$ npm i -g react gen
$ react-gen
```
or just use it with
```
$ npx react-gen
```

You then will be asked to provide a name for your component and to choose from a number of templates.

## Options

Currently there are no additional options supported.

## Configuration

Currently you have to fork the project to make modifications. In the future you will be able to configure your own templates based on a react-gen.config.js file.

### Change existing templates

### Add new templates

## To-Do
- [ ] Implement ability to pass component name and template directly through options
- [ ] Refactor generator and getTemplate function to allow user-defined templates
- [ ] Implement config file for easier configuration of templates
